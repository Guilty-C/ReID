  "prompt": "Look carefully at the person image and output exactly 4 short tokens, comma-separated: top color/type, bottom color/type, shoes color/type, bag color/type or none. Use lowercase nouns/adjectives only, no verbs, no body terms, no camera words. Keep it concise (â‰¤20 words). Prefer the most salient pattern or accessory. If bag not visible, write 'bag none'. Example outputs: 'blue jacket, black pants, white sneakers, bag none' | 'red dress, black heels, bag none, bag none'",
