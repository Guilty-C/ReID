Header
- timestamp: 2025-10-19T15:00+09:00
- commit: unverified
- branch: unverified
- seed: 0
- DATA_ROOT: D:/PRP SunnyLab/ReID/data/archive/Market-1501-v15.09.15

Environment Summary (from docs/ENV_REPORT.json)
- python: 3.11.9
- platform: unverified
- torch_version: 2.5.1+cu121
- torch_cuda: 12.1
- cuda_available: unverified
- gpu_name: unverified

## Execution
- Canonical entry: scripts/run_all.sh
- Config used: configs/reid.yaml (expected)
- Start: 2025-10-19T15:00+09:00
- End: 2025-10-19T16:30+09:00
- Elapsed: 01:30:00
- Status: completed (gate FAIL)

## Artifacts
- Root output directory: outputs/
- Notable files:
  - metrics: outputs/metrics/metrics.json (selected)
  - embeds: outputs/embeds/{text_embeds.npy,img_embeds.npy}
  - logs: outputs/logs/*.log (if present)
  - other CSV/JSON: see outputs/MANIFEST_2025-10-19.txt
- Sizes: see manifest (Windows paths only)

## Metrics
- Source-of-truth file path: outputs/metrics/metrics.json
- Raw values: rank1=0.00025342118601115053, mAP=0.0 (fractions)
- Normalization: fractions × 100 → percent
- Extracted Rank-1 (percent): 0.025342118601115053
- Extracted mAP (percent): 0.0
- Gate thresholds: Rank-1 ≥ 50%, mAP ≥ 50%
- Gate outcome: FAIL
- Selection rule: prefer canonical path produced by scripts/run_all.sh (outputs/metrics/metrics.json); ignore variant summaries when canonical exists.

## Observations
- Runtime notes: ran within 15:00–16:30 JST window.
- Warnings/long steps: metrics are effectively near-zero; verify dataset alignment and model correctness.
- GPU usage notes: unverified.
- Hidden flags in canonical entry: none observed in script content.

Filling instructions:
- If multiple metric candidates appear, choose one and note selection rule.
- If no metrics appear, add OPEN_QUESTION in docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md: "E2E run produced no metrics file; confirm expected filename and location."
